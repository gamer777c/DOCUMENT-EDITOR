# 📝 Real-Time Collaborative Text Editor

A lightweight, real-time collaborative text editor built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.io**. This web-based tool allows multiple users to simultaneously edit the same document and view each other's changes live, just like Google Docs or Notion.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the same document at the same time. Changes are synchronized instantly across all connected clients using WebSockets.
- 🧠 **Simple UI**: Minimalistic and clean interface using a plain HTML textarea.
- ⚙️ **Socket.io WebSocket Backend**: Live updates without refreshing the page.
- 🔧 **Easy Setup**: Run locally in minutes without any database or complex configuration.
